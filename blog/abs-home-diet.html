Surprisingly, your kitchen is a great place to start building abs. It’s important to fill your diet with lots of nutritious, whole foods, such as fruits, veggies, whole grains, healthy fats, and high-protein items.

These foods are not only high in micronutrients and antioxidants but also low in calories. Thus, they can support weight loss and increase fat burning.

Additionally, they supply fiber, protein, and healthy fats, all of which play a central role in improving body composition (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).

However, it’s important to focus on overall fat loss rather than spot reduction, which involves targeting a specific area of your body, such as your belly, for weight loss or fat burning.

Despite the popularity of this technique in the fitness industry, studies show that spot reduction is generally ineffective (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).

Additionally, keep in mind that diet isn’t the only factor when it comes to getting more defined abs.

In fact, getting regular physical activity is just as crucial to burning calories and toning your muscles.

SUMMARY
A diet for abs should include plenty of whole foods rich in fiber, protein, and healthy fats. It’s also important to focus on overall fat loss rather than spot reduction and pair your diet with regular physical activity.


Foods to eat
Aside from hitting the gym, choosing the right foods can help you get abs quicker. Here are a few of the best foods to eat on an ab-building diet.

Fruits and vegetables
Fruits and veggies are very nutrient-dense, meaning that they’re low in calories but high in antioxidants, fiber, and an assortment of vitamins and minerals (6Trusted Source).

They may also boost weight loss and fat burning, making them a must-have for any ab-building diet.

According to a review of 10 studies, eating at least 4 servings of veggies per day was associated with a lower risk of weight gain and reduced waist circumference in women (7Trusted Source).

Another study in 26,340 people showed that eating more fruits and veggies was linked to lower body weight and less overall body fat, while more fruit intake was tied to less belly fat (8Trusted Source).

Whole grains
Whole grains like oats, barley, buckwheat, and quinoa can be a great addition to your diet if you’re looking to get abs.

In addition to being high in fiber, which can enhance weight loss, digestion, and blood sugar levels, whole grains are a good source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).

Some research suggests that eating whole grains can reduce appetite and influence your body’s energy use, both of which can affect body composition (11Trusted Source).

One small, 12-week study in 50 people also found that swapping refined wheat bread for whole-grain wheat bread led to significant reductions in belly fat (12Trusted Source).

Nuts and seeds
Nuts and seeds provide the perfect balance of fiber, protein, and healthy fats, all of which can be incredibly beneficial for getting abs.

In a 6-week study in 48 people, eating 1.5 ounces (43 grams) of almonds per day led to significant reductions in belly fat (13Trusted Source).

Another study in 26 people showed that eating 1.2 ounces (35 grams) of chia flour daily for 12 weeks decreased body weight and waist circumference (14Trusted Source).

Pistachios, walnuts, almonds, pecans, and Brazil nuts are all great nuts to incorporate into your diet, alongside seeds like chia, flax, pumpkin, and hemp.

Fatty fish
Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which play a key role in heart health, brain function, inflammation, and weight control (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).

Eating fish can not only help you drop belly fat but also potentially reduce rick factors for heart disease, such as high triglyceride levels.

One study in 2,874 adults found that those who regularly ate fatty fish tended to have less belly fat and lower triglyceride levels. Similarly, eating lean fish was tied to lower waist circumference and triglyceride levels in women (18Trusted Source).

What’s more, fish is high in protein, which may promote abdominal toning.

Research suggests that higher protein intake may be associated with less belly fat and could help reduce appetite and increase weight loss (2Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).

Legumes
Legumes are a family of plants that include lentils, beans, peas, and peanuts.

They’re typically a great source of essential nutrients like protein, fiber, B vitamins, iron, copper, magnesium, and zinc (21Trusted Source).

In particular, eating more protein has been linked to improvements in body composition and reductions in belly fat (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).

Meanwhile, increased fiber intake is associated with weight loss and decreased belly fat (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).

Tea
Green tea has been studied for its potential to rev up weight loss and fat burning.

This is largely due to the presence of catechins like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a compound shown to increase the number of calories burned throughout the day (25Trusted Source).

One review of six studies noted that regular green tea intake led to a decrease in belly fat, weight, and waist circumference (26Trusted Source).<!-- --> <!-- --></pre><span>Posted on- <!-- -->20/05/2022<!-- --> <!-- --></span></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"getData":"{\n    \"data\": {\n      \"id\": 5,\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"title\": \"Abs Are Made in the Kitchen: Foods to Eat and Avoid\",\n        \"content\": \"How to eat for defined abs\\nSurprisingly, your kitchen is a great place to start building abs.
