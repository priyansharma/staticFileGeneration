You can find gyoza at most Japanese restaurants, especially izakaya or ramen shops. In Japan they have restaurants dedicated to only serving gyoza. They come frozen in bags at the grocery stores and there are gourmet shops that ship directly to your house so you can make restaurant specialty gyoza right in the comfort of your own home. Unfortunately they don’t ship world wide so the next best thing is making them at home from scratch. Spend some time making a batch or six, freeze the extras. The next time you’re hungry you can eat your bounty of resourcefulness.

Gyoza vs potstickers
Potsickers, or jiaozi or Chinese dumplings are essentially the same dish with some essential differences. Japanese gyoza tend to be a tiny bit smaller than potstickers and have thinner skins. They’re also seasoned differently, most notably heavier on the garlic.

How to make gyoza
Mix. First off make the filling by mixing everything into a homogeneous paste. The classic filling is pork, cabbage, nira (Chinese chives) or scallions, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sake, and toasted sesame oil.
Wrap. Add a tablespoon of filling to the middle of a round gyoza wrapper, lightly moisten the edges and pleat and press together the edges.
Fry. Heat up a bit of oil in a non stick frying pan, brown the bottoms, add a bit of water and cover the pan to steam. When all of the water evaporates, lift off the lid, let the bottoms crisp up a bit and you’re done.
Eat. Enjoy hot and crispy with soy sauce, rice vinegar, and chili oil for dipping!<!-- --> <!-- --></pre><span>Posted on- <!-- -->20/05/2022<!-- --> <!-- --></span></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"getData":"{\n    \"data\": {\n      \"id\": 4,\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"title\": \"How to make gyoza from scratch like an expert.\",\n        \"content\": \"What are gyoza?\\nGyoza are Japanese dumplings.
